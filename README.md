# Carcassonne

This is a project I completed in my second programming class at UA, CSC 120. You can see the overall project description here:

Carcassonne is a board game which involves strategic tile placement to win the game. Players must place landscape tiles in a 
way which will create the most advantageous path for their meeples and which will prove to be a challenge for opponents.
The game is simulated using two program files, one which represents the overall game map, and the other which
creates the tiles necessary for creating the map.

carcassonne_map.py
PURPOSE: This program works in conjunction with
carcassonne_tile.py to recreate the Carcassonne
game digitally. It allows the user to place created
tiles in certain locations, following the rules
of the game. It contains one class, CarcassonneMap.
   
carcassonne_tile.py
PURPOSE: This program contains functions for
creating and getting information about the
Carcassonne game tiles. They are all a part 
of the CarcassonneTile class used to make
create each tile.
